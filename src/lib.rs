//! Enigo lets you simulate mouse and keyboard input-events as if they were
//! made by the actual hardware. It is available on Linux (X11), macOS and
//! Windows.
//!
//! It can be used for testing user interfaces on different platforms, building
//! remote control applications or just automating tasks for user interfaces
//! unaccessible by a public API or scripting language.
//!
//! This library is in an early alpha status, the API will change in
//! in the future.
//!
//! In order to use the library, you only have to know about three
//! things:
//! - [`KeyboardControllable`] (trait): used to simulate a key click, enter text
//!   or something similar
//! - [`MouseControllable`] (trait): do something with the mouse or you find out
//!   the display
//! size
//! - [`Enigo`] (struct): implements the two traits [`KeyboardControllable`] and
//!   [`MouseControllable`]
//!
//! A simple [DSL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language)
//! is available. It is documented in the [`dsl`] module.

//! # Examples
//! ```no_run
//! use enigo::*;
//! let mut enigo = Enigo::new(&EnigoSettings::default()).unwrap();
//! //paste
//! enigo.key_down(Key::Control);
//! enigo.key_click(Key::Layout('v'));
//! enigo.key_up(Key::Control);
//! ```
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use enigo::*;
//! let mut enigo = Enigo::new(&EnigoSettings::default()).unwrap();
//! enigo.mouse_move_to(500, 200);
//! enigo.mouse_down(MouseButton::Left);
//! enigo.mouse_move_relative(100, 100);
//! enigo.mouse_up(MouseButton::Left);
//! enigo.key_sequence("hello world");
//! ```
