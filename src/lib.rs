//! Enigo lets you simulate mouse and keyboard input-events as if they were
//! made by the actual hardware. It is available on Linux (X11), macOS and
//! Windows.
//!
//! It can be used for testing user interfaces on different platforms, building
//! remote control applications or just automating tasks for user interfaces
//! unaccessible by a public API or scripting language.
//!
//! This library is in an early alpha status, the API will change in
//! in the future.
//!
//! In order to use the library, you only have to know about three
//! things:
//! - [`Keyboard`] (trait): used to simulate a key click, enter text or
//!   something similar
//! - [`Mouse`] (trait): do something with the mouse or you find out the display
//!   size
//! - [`Enigo`] (struct): implements the two traits [`Keyboard`] and [`Mouse`]
//!
//! This crate previously included a simple DSL. This is no longer the case. In order to simplify the codebase and also allow serializing objects, you can now serialize and deserialize most enums and structs of this crate. You can use this instead of the DSL. This feature is hidden behind the `serde` feature. Have a look at the `serde` example to see how to use it to serialize Tokens in the [RON](https://crates.io/crates/ron) format.

//! # Examples
//! ```no_run
//! use enigo::{
//!     Button, Coordinate,
//!     Direction::{Click, Press, Release},
//!     Enigo, Key, Keyboard, Mouse, Settings,
//! };
//! let mut enigo = Enigo::new(&Settings::default()).unwrap();
//! // Paste
//! enigo.key(Key::Control, Press);
//! enigo.key(Key::Unicode('v'), Click);
//! enigo.key(Key::Control, Release);
//! // Do things with the mouse
//! enigo.move_mouse(500, 200, Coordinate::Abs);
//! enigo.button(Button::Left, Press);
//! enigo.move_mouse(100, 100, Coordinate::Rel);
//! enigo.button(Button::Left, Release);
//! // Enter text
//! enigo.text("hello world");
//! ```
